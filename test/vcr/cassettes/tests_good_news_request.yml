        woes]]>\n    </title>\n    <byline>The Sports Xchange</byline>\n    <dateline></dateline>\n
        \   <credit>The Sports Xchange</credit>\n    <content>\n      <long>\n        <![CDATA[DAVIE,
        Fla. -- Miami coach Adam Gase, whose Dolphins (1-2) visit Cincinnati (1-2)
        on Thursday, acknowledges the Dolphins have problems on third downs offensively.
        They rank 26th in third-down conversions at 30.3 percent.\n\nBut Gase points
        to the offensive line as a primary reason the team is struggling in that area.\n\n\"The
        third-down stuff, the problem with that is if we could just stay on our blocks,\"
        he said. \"We got exactly what we want as far as guys coming open. It's hard
        to throw a ball with any kind of timing where they pressure, and we get it
        picked up, but we get beat so fast that the quarterback, he doesn't even have
        a chance.\"\n\nGase could have bigger problems on that front this week.\n\nMiami,
        which ranks 25th in rushing offense at 83 yards per game, not only has performance
        issues on the offensive line, it also has injury issues.\n\nLeft tackle Branden
        Albert (ankle) is questionable, and center Anthony Steen (ankle) is probable.
        Right tackle Ja'Wuan James, benched in overtime of last week's 30-24 victory
        over Cleveland, is in flux based on his performance.\n\nGase wants to see
        consistency, no matter who is healthy. He said it's tough for quarterback
        Ryan Tannehill to get into a rhythm because of the offensive line concerns.\n\n\"There
        have been a couple times we're getting pressure,\" Gase began, \"(and) he
        just knows that where he's throwing it should be wide open, and he just throws
        it up knowing . ...there was one to (wide receiver) Jarvis (Landry), he threw
        it in that area knowing, 'There's nobody there if I could get a second to
        get it there.' That's the frustrating part about playing quarterback.\n\n\"It's
        like I told you guys last week, you need 10 other guys to do their job before
        you have a chance to do your job. Sometimes when we have these minor errors
        as far as (you) don't sustain your block for one second, all of a sudden there's
        an issue.\"\n\nGase is hoping things improve this week. But there aren't many
        more options in the offensive line. Reserve guard-tackle Billy Turner, guard-tackle
        Dallas Thomas and center-guard Kraig Urbik all had shots at starting jobs
        in training camp and lost.\n\nStill, Gase might have few tricks up his sleeve.
        Asked whether the Dolphins could make adjustments on this short week he had
        a firm answer.\n\n\"You'd be surprised. ...you can get creative,\" he said,
        \"and you can figure out what to do in a short period of time and guys adjust
        and you walk through it and you roll.\"]]>\n      </long>\n    </content>\n

        their first two games by a total of four points, including a 16-13 loss to
        the New York Giants in Week 2, the New Orleans Saints were excited about coming
        home for a Monday Night Football matchup with the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nWhen
        the Saints drove 75 yards to a touchdown on their first possession in front
        of a raucous crowd in the Superdome, it looked like it might be one of those
        magical nights. \n\nBut it didn't last long.\n\nAfter the Saints muffed a
        punt on the Falcons' first series, which led to the first of five consecutive
        touchdown drives before the visitors had to settle for a field goal, the party
        was just about over.\n\nThe Falcons won 45-32 vs. a Saints (0-3) team that
        was missing more than half of its projected defensive starters before the
        season began. The hopes that a new season brings have just about been shattered
        for winless New Orleans.\n\nFalcons quarterback Matt Ryan took what he wanted
        after the running game netted 217 yards and a 7.0 average with three touchdowns
        against a Saints' defense that has been ravaged by injuries.\n\nBut the Saints
        say they aren't about to let the injuries get in the way of their mission
        to win games no matter who is on the field.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we
        have to go,\" strong safety Roman Harper said. \"There's no excuses. Of course
        we'll talk, we'll get things corrected. How many more times are we going to
        have to go through this?\"\n\nThere's no telling, especially without prized
        defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins on injured reserve until early November and
        strong safety Kenny Vaccaro, one of their top run-stoppers, sitting on the
        sideline with an ankle problem.\n\nAllowing 217 rushing yards and 7.0 yards
        per carry was the biggest problem Monday night with the Falcons taking advantage
        of a wounded secondary after the Saints failed to stop the run early.\n\n\"We
        have to stop the run better than we stopped the run,\" coach Sean Payton said.
        \"They were over 200 yards in situations when you knew the run was coming,
        even at the end of the game.\"\n\nThat's no good, but it's no excuse, either.\n\n\n\nREPORT
        CARD VS. FALCONS\n\nPASSING OFFENSE: B -- Despite missing one of his top weapons
        in wide receiver Willie Snead, who was out with a toe injury, Drew Brees completed
        36 of 54 passes for 376 yards with three touchdowns and one interception in
        the loss to the Falcons. Brees was sacked twice, but he had decent protection
        for most of the game and finished with a passer rating of 97.5. Four players
        caught at least six passes, with Coby Fleener, Brandon Coleman and Michael
        Thomas catching seven each and Travaris Cadet getting six. Fleener had a big
        night after two rough outings and finished with 109 receiving yards and a
        2-yard touchdown in the first quarter. Thomas had a 3-yard scoring catch and
        Mark Ingram caught a 5-yard touchdown pass in the final period.\n\nRUSHING
        OFFENSE: B -- Seeking more balance after having just 13 attempts in the previous
        game, the Saints had their best rushing day of the season. They picked up
        115 yards and averaged 5.0 yards a pop on 23 carries with Ingram leading the
        way. He has 77 yards and a 5.1 average on 15 attempts with a long run of 17
        yards. Tim Hightower also had some strong carries with 19 yards -- including
        an 11-yarder -- on three attempts and fullback John Kuhn had a 3-yard touchdown
        run.\n\nPASS DEFENSE: D -- Facing a patchwork secondary that was without starting
        cornerbacks Delvin Breaux and P.J. Williams and starting strong safety Kenny
        Vaccaro, Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan had a huge night. Ryan didn't really
        have to throw a lot because of an effective running game, but he still hit
        on 20 of 30 attempts for 240 yards and two touchdowns with only two sacks
        en route to compiling a passer rating of 113.2. The Saints held Julio Jones
        to one catch for 16 yards, but Ryan took the underneath stuff with Devonta
        Freeman and Tevin Coleman combining for eight catches for 102 yards out of
        the backfield. Freeman also had a 13-yard touchdown reception.\n\nRUSH DEFENSE:
        F -- After the Saints had a strong performance against the New York Giants
        in their previous outing in allowing 2.0 yards per attempt, it all came apart
        against the Falcons. Freeman and Coleman combined for 26 carries and 194 yards
        with Freeman doing the most damage with 152 yards and a 10.9 average on 14
        carries. He had a long gain of 48 yards. Coleman had only 42 yards on 12 attempts,
        but he had touchdown runs of 2, 2 and 6 yards. On the 6-yard run, he easily
        raced to the goal-line pylon without a Saints' defender in sight. Ryan also
        scrambled five times for 23 yards, helping the Falcons finish with 217 yards
        and a 7.0 average on 31 rushes.\n\nSPECIAL TEAMS: B-minus -- The highlight
        of the night for the Saints was rookie kicker Wil Lutz's 57-yard field goal
        on the final play of the first half. Thomas Morstead punted two times for
        a 41.5 gross and net average with a long of 49. The Saints had no kickoff
        or punt returns, but they did have a major problem when Da'Vante Harris ran
        into return man Tommylee Lewis, then picked up the ball and tried to run before
        fumbling. The Falcons turned that first-quarter miscue into their first touchdown
        of the night. The Saints also allowed 27.0 yards on two kickoff returns, including
        a 42-yarder.\n\nCOACHING: B -- It's hard to blame everything on the coaching
        staff, but the Saints, who lost their first two games by a total of four points,
        were blown away late by the Falcons. The Saints, who were missing half of
        their starting unit on defense, get some credit for the fact that they were
        down by only 10 points and driving to a touchdown early in the fourth quarter
        before Deion Jones intercepted a Drew Brees pass and returned it 90 yards
        for score that pretty much sealed the deal.]]>\n      </long>\n    </content>\n

        -- Saints quarterback Drew Brees' lengthy streak of pass attempts without
        an interception was snapped with a thud Monday night in a 45-32 loss to the
        Atlanta Falcons in the Superdome.\n\nThe NFL's fourth-longest streak of passes
        without a pick ended at 305 in the fourth quarter when Falcons rookie linebacker
        Deion Jones, a New Orleans native who played at LSU, intercepted Brees and
        raced 90 yards to a touchdown to extend his team's lead to 45-25.\n\nThe backbreaking
        interception came one play after Brees connected with Mark Ingram on pass
        No. 305. In the third quarter, Brees joined Tom Brady (358), Alex Smith (312)
        and Bernie Kosar (308) as the only quarterbacks in NFL history to have a streak
        of at least 300 passes without an interception.\n\n--As if an 0-3 start to
        the season wasn't bad enough, the Saints continue to battle injuries -- especially
        to their offensive line.\n\nIn Monday night's game with the Falcons, left
        tackle Terron Armstead wasn't available because of a knee injury that kept
        him out of practice last week. That meant left guard Andrus Peat had to move
        outside to replace Armstead.\n\nThen, Kelemete, who plays all five offensive
        line positions, was penciled into the lineup after playing right tackle the
        previous game when Zach Strief suffered a chest injury against the New York
        Giants.\n\nBut Kelemete left the game in the third quarter with a hamstring
        injury and didn't return. He was expected to have an MRI on Tuesday to determine
        the severity of the injury.\n\nKelemete's spot was taken by Tim Lelito, who
        started most of the 2015 season at left guard. When the game ended, the Saints
        had only six healthy linemen -- Lelito, Strief, Peat, center Max Unger, right
        guard Jahri Evans and guard Landon Turner.\n\n--Since winning 11 consecutive
        games in the Superdome during the 2013 and '14 seasons, the Saints have now
        lost 11 of their last 15 games in front of the home fans.\n\nThe Saints actually
        went 8-0 at home in 2013 and won three in a row to start the 2014 season before
        starting the rough patch with a 27-24 overtime loss to the San Francisco on
        Nov. 9, 2014, in their fourth home game of the season.\n\nThey lost the final
        four games at home that year, then went 4-4 at home in 2015 before starting
        this season with back-to-back losses to the Oakland Raiders (35-34) and Falcons.\n\n--The
        Saints-Falcons game was played 10 years and one day after a renovated Superdome,
        which was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, re-opened.\n\nOn
        that night, Sept. 25, 2006, the Saints returned with a rush when special teams
        ace Steve Gleason blocked a punt in the opening minutes and teammate Curtis
        Deloatch scooped it up and scored to spark an emotional 23-3 bashing of the
        Falcons.\n\nTo celebrate the anniversary, Gleason, who has suffered from ALS
        for the past 5 1/2 years, was on hand and served as honorary captain for the
        pregame coin toss. Also, Irma Thomas, the \"Soul Queen of New Orleans,\" performed
        the national anthem as she did a decade ago.\n\n--The Falcons blowout of the
        Saints was hardly \"must-see TV\" material.\n\nThe game pulled an overnight
        rating of 5.6, which is far below the average for Monday Night Football telecasts
        according to ESPN. That equates to about 10 million viewers.\n\nThe Washington
        Post reported Tuesday that, if the numbers hold up, it could be the least-watched
        game in Monday Night Football history.\n\nSome of the downturn could be attributed
        to the first presidential debate, which started a half-hour after the Saints
        and Falcons kicked off. Reuters reported the debate drew a record 84 million
        viewers.\n\n--LT Terron Armstead did not play against the Atlanta Falcons
        on Monday night because of a knee injury and it's not known when he will return.\n\n--WR
        Willie Snead, the Saints' No. 2 receiving option, was inactive against the
        Falcons because of a toe injury and it's not known when he'll return.\n\n--SS
        Kenny Vaccaro, who suffered an ankle injury in Week 2, did not play against
        the Falcons and his return is unknown.\n\n--DT Tyeler Davison missed Monday
        night's game because of shoulder and foot injuries and it's not known when
        he'll return to the lineup.\n\n--LCB Delvin Breaux was out for a second consecutive
        game Monday night as he continues to rehab from ankle surgery and could return
        in late October.\n\n--TE Josh Hill, who sprained an ankle in the season opener,
        was out for the second week in a row and his return is not known.\n\n--WLB
        Dannell Ellerbe missed his third consecutive game with a quadriceps injury
        and it's uncertain when he'll be able to practice or play.\n\n--LT Andrus
        Peat, who started the first two games at left guard, took the place of an
        injured Terron Armstead at left tackle.\n\n--LG Senio Kelemete, who started
        because Andrus Peat was shifted to left tackle, suffered a hamstring injury
        in the third quarter and did not return.\n\n--LG Tim Lelito replaced an injured
        Senio Kelemete in the third quarter and played the remainder of Monday night's
        game with the Falcons.\n\n--SS Roman Harper, who rejoined the Saints this
        summer, made his first start of the season in place of Kenny Vaccaro.]]>\n

        Texans defensive end J.J. Watt, the reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year,
        was placed on injured reserve on Wednesday.\n\n\"Adversity sucks,\" Watt wrote
        via social media shortly after the move was made public. \"Your attitude towards
        it doesn't have to. I will be back.\" \n\nWatt said the move was \"necessary
        in order for me to return to 100 percent and play at the level that I am capable
        of playing at. Everybody deals with adversity in their lives,  many much worse
        than what I'm going through. ... I look forward to the fight back to the top
        and to the next time that I can step back on that field with my brothers to
        play the game that I love before the best fans in the world and I promise
        to continue to do everything in my power to make you proud.\"\n\nWatt underwent
        back surgery in late July and sat out the preseason. He returned to play each
        of the Texans' first three regular-season games, but observers wondered if
        he was actually healthy.\n\nWatt said before the start of the regular season
        that there was a time during rehab from surgery when he feared he might never
        play again.\n\n\"After the first surgery, there were some days there where
        I really questioned whether or not I'd ever be able to play again,\" he said
        before Week 1. \"Just some of the stuff we were dealing with from a rehab
        standpoint, just the way that the recovery was going early on -- there was
        a very low point there, and it was tough.\"\n\nA move to short-term injured
        reserve would keep Watt out of practice for six weeks, with a chance to return
        to action in eight weeks for a Nov. 27 game against the San Diego Chargers.
        \n\nHowever, ESPN's Ed Werder reported Wednesday that sources in Houston called
        a comeback this season \"a longshot.\" Werder also reported Watt is seeking
        a second opinion but the injury is the same disk that required surgery on
        July 22.\n\nThe Texans agreed to a deal with defensive end Antonio Smith on
        Wednesday. Smith has played for the Texans and is familiar with defensive
        coordinator Romeo Crennel's scheme.\n\nWatt, 27, managed only eight tackles
        and 1.5 sacks through three weeks this season. It was a significant drop-off
        from last season, when he recorded 17.5 sacks and three forced fumbles en
        route to his third Defensive Player of the Year honor. He also captured the
        award in 2012 and 2014, finishing with 20.5 sacks and four forced fumbles
        each year.\n\nWatt, Houston's 2011 first-round pick (11th overall) out of
        Wisconsin, has 76 sacks, 15 forced fumbles and one interception in 83 games,
        all starts. He has never missed a regular-season game.\n\nWatt's rate of 0.92
        sacks per game is higher than any other player since the stat was first established
        in 1982.]]>\n      </long>\n    </content>\n    <refs>\n      <ref sportradar_id=\"82d2d380-3834-4938-835f-aec541e5ece7\"

        \   <content>\n      <long>\n        <![CDATA[Miami (1-2) at Cincinnati (1-2)\n\nKICKOFF:
        Thursday, 8:25 p.m. ET, Paul Brown Stadium. TV: NFL Network, Jim Nantz, Phil
        Simms, Tracy Wolfson\n\nSERIES HISTORY: 21st regular-season meeting. Miami
        leads 15-5. Miami defeated Cincinnati 22-20 in overtime in 2013 on Halloween.
        That game was memorable because it was the same night the story broke that
        former offensive tackle Jonathan Martin alleged he was bullied by ex-guard
        Richie Incognito. The game ended on a safety when defensive end Cam Wake sacked
        quarterback Andy Dalton in the end zone with 6:38 left in OT.\n\nGAMEDATE:
        9/29/16\n\nKEYS TO THE GAME: Cincinnati needs a win badly and so does Miami.
        But the Bengals are playing at home and coming off a disheartening loss to
        Denver in a game that they led in the second half. Cincinnati did a decent
        job of keeping pressure off Andy Dalton and keeping Broncos Super Bowl MVP
        Von Miller under wraps, but they face another challenge Thursday in Ndamukong
        Suh. \n\nLook for the Bengals to establish the running game early, which they
        managed for a while at Denver. Dalton will likely be without Pro Bowl tight
        end Tyler Eifert, who is listed as doubtful following offseason ankle surgery.
        He led all tight ends with 13 touchdowns last year and caught 52 passes for
        615 yards in 13 games.\n\nBengals linebackers need to keep Dolphins quarterback
        Ryan Tannehill in the pocket. He is Miami's leading rusher through three games,
        averaging 4.5 per carry, and is only 40 yards shy of a franchise record for
        rushing yards by a quarterback.\n\nThe Dolphins must find something that works
        offensively and defensively. Miami wants its offense to be led by the passing
        game and its defense to be led by the defensive line, but both have been spotty,
        at best.\n\nMATCHUPS TO WATCH:\n\n--Bengals WR A.J. Green vs. Dolphins CB
        Xavien Howard. This is interesting because it could have a ripple effect.
        Last week, Cleveland's Terrelle Pryor did so well against Howard, a rookie
        second-round pick, that Miami moved CB Byron Maxwell to cover Pryor. That
        could happen again this week. Pryor torched both of them (eight receptions,
        144 yards).\n\n--Dolphins' run offense vs. Bengals' run defense. Miami must
        find a way to run the ball effectively so it has some sort of balance. Right
        now, the Dolphins have 113 passes to 62 runs, almost a 2-to-1 ratio. Some
        of that is because the Dolphins trailed and had to pass, but their rushing
        offense (83 yards per game) is 25th in the NFL. The combination of Bengals
        DT Geno Atkins and LBs Karlos Dansby, Vontaze Burfict and Rey Maualuga might
        be too much.\n\nPLAYER SPOTLIGHT: Dolphins RT Ja'Wuan James. The 2015 first-round
        pick was yanked last week for the overtime period against Cleveland because
        of poor performance. Coach Adam Gase hasn't yet indicated whether James will
        start. Gase has James, and perhaps a few other starters, on a short leash.
        James will likely spend most of his time against Bengals DE Carlos Dunlap.\n\nFAST
        FACTS: Dolphins QB Ryan Tannehill won both of his previous starts vs. the
        Bengals while posting a 92.4 passer rating. He passed for 319 yards and three
        touchdowns TDs last week, and he aims for third game with 300-plus yards.
        ... Bengals QB Andy Dalton leads AFC with 938 passing yards. In his past 10
        home games, he has 16 touchdowns, six interceptions and a 103 passer rating.\n\nPREDICTION:
        The Bengals, and Dalton, face a Miami defense that allowed Cleveland 430 total
        yards, and the Dolphins escaped with a W only because the Browns missed makeable
        field goals.\n\nOUR PICK: Bengals, 27-10.\n\n--Frank Cooney]]>\n      </long>\n

        Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz and Denver Broncos quarterback Trevor Siemian
        were named Offensive Player of the Week in their respective conferences.\n\nWentz,
        the second overall pick from North Dakota State in this year's draft, has
        led the Eagles to a 3-0 start in winning the NFC honor announced Wednesday
        for Week 3.\n\nWentz threw for 301 yards and two touchdowns with a passer
        rating of 125.9 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, leading the Eagles to a dominating
        34-3 win.\n\nSiemian was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance
        in Denver's 29-17 win over the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nSiemian, who replaced
        retired Peyton Manning this season, completed 23 of 35 for 312 yards with
        four touchdowns with a 132.1 passer rating as the Broncos also started 3-0.\n\nMinnesota
        Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen took the NFC defensive award after his
        three-sack performance in the 22-10 win over the Carolina Panthers on the
        road.\n\nKansas City Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters had two of the team's
        six interceptions in the 24-3 win over the New York Jets to win the AFC Defensive
        Player of the Week.\n\nNew England Patriots punter Ryan Allen took the AFC
        special teams honor for his performance in the 27-0 victory over the Houston
        Texans last Thursday night. Allen punted seven times for a 47.6 average and
        placed punts inside the 20-yard line at the 11, 10, 10, 14, 5 and 4.\n\nWashington
        Redskins kicker Dustin Hopkins won the NFC special teams award for his performance
        in the team's 29-27 win against the New York Giants. Hopkins converted all
        five field-goal attempts. He is 11-for-11 on field goals this season and has

        in London. \n\nThis year's opponent will be the Indianapolis Colts, a foe
        from the AFC South, making their first trip across the pond to play a game
        in front of 80,000 fans.\n\nLondon is familiar territory for coach Gus Bradley
        and the Jaguars. Jacksonville has been a four-year participant in the International
        Series dating back to 2013 and has committed to play a game in London through
        the 2020 season. Needless to say, it's quite a change for players, some of
        whom are making their first trip overseas. \n\nMaking the adjustment to the
        five-hour time change is often the biggest obstacle to overcome. The secret
        for some who have done the trip in the past is to be able to sleep on the
        13-hour plane ride to and from London.\n\n\"I can't sleep on the plane so
        I'm probably going to have to get the sleeping pill,\" Jaguars outside linebacker
        Dan Skuta said. \"It's weird because I don't think I've ever heard where you
        drug yourself to go to a game. Hopefully I'll be able to get some sleep because
        if you don't you're in trouble. You have to sleep on the plane. That's the
        most important thing. That's really everything. Because if you do sleep on
        the plane, when you wake up, it's just a normal day. As long as you can get
        your body on that schedule as quick as possible, that's the key.\"\n\nThen
        there's a matter of when the team should arrive in London. Based on typical
        game-week schedules, teams have opted for early arrival - Tuesday night -
        or much later Friday.\n\nIn 2013 when Jacksonville made its first trip to
        London, the Jaguars played at Cincinnati the week before. Immediately after
        the game, the team and other personnel loaded up a charter jet overseas. That
        meant all of the Jaguars' personnel was in London for parts of eight different
        days. Most players feel that's too long to be there.\n\n\"I think it's good
        to go over there and experience something different and give the people there
        a chance to see American football,\" said wide receiver Marqise Lee who will
        make his fourth trip to London this Thursday. \"I like going over and arriving
        on a Friday. My first year we were there a week and I really don't prefer
        to do that, that was too long. It just takes a day to get your body adjusted.\"\n\nSkuta
        will make his third trip to London in the last four years. He was part of
        the San Francisco team that played the Jaguars in 2013. He made a return trip
        there last year after signing with Jacksonville as a free agent during the
        offseason.\n\n\"We went out for a week that first trip so that's a little
        different,\" Skuta said. \"We had a great result (42-10 win over the Jaguars)
        when we went out for a week. It's all different. The Bills went out for a
        week last year and we ended up winning that game. It's good both ways, it's
        whatever you prefer.\"\n\nJaguars' players say while the experience is good
        and the atmosphere with foreign fans is most supportive. For 0-3 Jacksonville,
        a win is the most important part of this trip. Some national outlets have
        wondered aloud whether Bradley could be coaching for his job. He's 12-39 in
        three seasons following last week's loss to the Ravens. Week 2 at San Diego,
        the Jaguars fell behind 35-0. \n\nJacksonville has a bye week upon returning
        from the UK.\n\n\"Playing in front of the fans there, you try and not get
        into that too much,\" defensive end Tyson Alualu said. \"Those of us in the
        locker room know who we are and what we stand for. It's always exciting to
        go to London with the fan base that we have over there. Maybe it is good to
        get away a little bit. But our main focus is going there and taking care of
        business and coming back with a win.\"]]>\n      </long>\n    </content>\n

        wide receiver Dez Bryant has been diagnosed with a slight hairline fracture
        in his right knee, but the team is hoping he can still play Sunday. \n\nCoach
        Jason Garrett, speaking to reporters Wednesday, confirmed Bryant's injury
        and said \"we're hopeful that he'll be able to play\" against the San Francisco
        49ers.\n\n\"He has a slight hairline fracture in one of the bones of his knees,\"
        Garrett told reporters during a conference call. \"We don't think it's something
        that's going to keep him out for an extended period of time but again it's
        going to be a day-by-day, week-by-week situation.\"\n\nA source told ESPN's
        Adam Schefter that the injury potentially could sideline Bryant up to three
        weeks.\n\nAnother source told ESPN's Ed Werder that the Cowboys want to see
        how Bryant responds to treatment and that he won't require surgery to fix
        the fracture.\n\nBryant, who sustained the knee injury against the Chicago
        Bears on Sunday night, did not practice Wednesday.\n\nEarlier in the day,
        Garrett would not say when Bryant had an MRI even though the star receiver
        tweeted Wednesday after a fan asked about the results: \"We'll find out today.\"\n\nBryant
        was injured on the second play of Sunday's game when Bears linebacker Christian
        Jones dragged the receiver down after an 11-yard gain. Bryant missed six plays
        before returning and finished with three catches for 40 yards, including his
        first touchdown of the season.\n\nThe Cowboys and Garrett initially downplayed
        quarterback Tony Romo's injury when he suffered a compression fracture in
        his back during a preseason game.\n\nOn Aug. 27, Garrett said Romo's back
        didn't \"look like anything serious.\" Romo is expected to miss at least six
        games.\n\nAfter the 31-17 win at AT&T Stadium, owner and general manager Jerry
        Jones said Bryant would have more tests Monday.\n\nJones told 105.3 The Fan
        on Tuesday morning that Bryant did not yet have an MRI and \"maybe\" would
        get one later in the day. Jones said he expected Bryant to play this week
        against the 49ers.\n\n\"He hasn't taken an MRI to my knowledge, so I'm assuming
        he's going to go,\" Jones said Tuesday. \"He certainly finished the game out.
        That in and of itself is a good indication, it doesn't mean he's going to
        be free of the symptoms or the injury, but again we may look at an MRI before
        this day is over.\"\n\nSeveral other injuries cloud the Cowboys' depth chart
        for Week 4.\n\nLeft guard La'el Collins visited foot specialist James Anderson
        in North Carolina for a second opinion on his sprained big toe. When Cowboys
        running back Felix Jones went to Anderson for his opinion in 2008, he wound
        up having season-ending surgery. \n\nLeft tackle Tyron Smith (back) was not
        on the field Wednesday but Garrett said the tightness that crept up two days
        before the Cowboys-Bears game Sunday is mostly gone.\n\nCornerback Orlando
        Scandrick was limited Wednesday. He had tightness in both hamstrings and missed
        Week 3.]]>\n      </long>\n    </content>\n    <refs>\n      <ref sportradar_id=\"e627eec7-bbae-4fa4-8e73-8e1d6bc5c060\"

        RB Smallwood coming up large for Eagles]]>\n    </title>\n    <byline>The

        Xchange</credit>\n    <content>\n      <long>\n        <![CDATA[Wendell Smallwood
        wasn't selected until the fifth round of the draft by the Philadelphia Eagles
        this spring. The late selection, however, didn't mean that they considered
        the 5-foot10, 208-pound running back out of West Virginia an afterthought.\n\nSmallwood
        reportedly slipped in the draft because of some character questions, but the
        Eagles felt he was worth the risk in the fifth round and believed he could
        help them right away.\n\nBut just days into his first NFL training camp, Smallwood
        sustained a quad injury that kept him sidelined for the better part of three
        weeks. \n\nHe made it back for the Eagles' third preseason game, but suffered
        a concussion in the second quarter. He ended the preseason with just two carries.\n\nSmallwood
        played just seven offensive snaps in the Eagles' first two regular-season
        games and had three carries for 17 yards.\n\nWith Ryan Mathews slowed by an
        ankle injury on Sunday, Smallwood finally got an opportunity to strut his
        stuff. He rushed for 79 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries in the Eagles'
        impressive 34-3 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nSmallwood, who was the
        Division I leader in runs of 10 or more yards last year at West Virginia,
        had four double-digit-yard runs against the Steelers. One of them, a 12-yard
        run that included a nifty second-level spin move to avoid two tacklers, set
        up his 1-yard third-quarter scoring run that gave Philadelphia a 27-3 lead.\n\n\"It
        felt good to finally get into the flow of the game and get comfortable,\"
        Smallwood said. \"I had been feeling like a deer in headlights. It was good
        to get on a roll and finally get comfortable.\"\n\nThe Eagles (3-0) need to
        be able to run the ball effectively to take the pressure off rookie quarterback
        Carson Wentz.\n\nMathews is a talented runner, but has trouble staying healthy,
        and really isn't a guy who can handle a regular heavy load. He had 22 carries
        in the Eagles' season-opening win against Cleveland, but has had just 11 carries
        since.\n\nThe Eagles' No. 2 rusher, 5-foot-6, 190-pound Darren Sproles, is
        more receiver than running back. Which means the Eagles need significant contributions
        from both Smallwood and their other running back, Kenjon Barner, if they hope
        to make a serious playoff run.\n\n\"(Running backs coach) Duce (Staley) told
        me they're going to keep working me in slowly every game,\" Smallwood said.
        \"The better I do the more I'm going to play. I just want to keep getting
        those guys to believe in me, and believe I can go out there and make plays.\"\n\n--Lane
        Johnson's appeal hearing on his 10-game performance-enhancing drug suspension
        is next Tuesday. The arbitrator is not expected to rule in his favor, which
        means he likely will begin his suspension Oct. 9 when the Eagles face the
        Lions in Detroit. \n\nLeft guard Allen Barbre will move over and replace Johnson
        at right tackle during his suspension. Veteran Stefen Wisniewski is expected
        to replace Barbre at left guard.\n\n--Last summer, the Eagles signed linebacker
        Mychal Kendricks to a four-year, $29 million contract extension, nearly $12
        million of which was guaranteed. Kendricks went out last year and had the
        worst season of his career. \n\nThis year, he quickly fell out of favor with
        Eagles' new defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz.\n\nEven though he is the team's
        most athletic linebacker, he was removed from their two-linebacker nickel
        packages. In Sunday's 34-3 win over Pittsburgh, Kendricks played just nine
        defensive snaps. \n\n\"Their offensive personnel basically just dictated that
        for us,\" coach Doug Pederson said.\n\n--Carson Wentz has thrown 102 passes
        without an interception, which is the most by a rookie to start his career.\n\nWentz
        had a 125.9 passer rating against the Steelers, which is the highest by an
        Eagles rookie. \n\nAsked how he has managed to deal so well with the speed
        of the NFL game, he said, \"For me, I've always felt like I've played at a
        fast level. The coaches and the offensive line are making my job easy. The
        coaches are putting us in a great situation with the preparation we put in
        each week and the film work. So the preparation really helps the game slow
        down for me.\"]]>\n      </long>\n    </content>\n    <refs>\n      <ref sportradar_id=\"386bdbf9-9eea-4869-bb9a-274b0bc66e80\"

        defensive lineman Anthony Johnson to their practice squad on Wednesday.\n\nJohnson,
        23, was released by the Patriots on Monday. He originally entered the NFL
        as a rookie free agent with the Miami Dolphins on May 12, 2014.\n\nThe 6-foot-2,
        295-pound Johnson out of LSU made the Dolphins' 53-man roster as a rookie
        and played in seven games, recording two tackles and recovering one fumble.
        He was released by Miami at the end of training camp in 2015 and signed by
        the Washington Redskins' practice squad in November. Johnson was released
        by Washington on May 2.\n\nJohnson was signed by the Patriots on May 9 and
        played in two games in 2016 with the Patriots, accumulating five total tackles
        and one quarterback hit.\n\nTo make room, the Patriots released offensive
        lineman Ian Silberman from the practice squad.\n\nSilberman, 23, was signed
        to the practice squad on Sept. 15. He originally entered the NFL as a sixth-round
        pick by the San Francisco 49ers out of Boston College in 2015. \n\nThe 6-5,

        Browns knew they would have to make adjustments on the offensive line when
        center Alex Mack signed with Atlanta and right tackle Mitchell Schwartz joined
        Kansas City in free agency. \n\nAfter just three games, the challenge is bigger
        than expected.\n\nJohn Greco will be at center for the second straight week
        on Sunday (1 p.m. ET) when the Browns (0-3) visit the Washington Redskins
        (1-2). Grego will get the nod with center Cameron Erving still recovering
        from a bruised lung.\n\nThat isn't the biggest issue, however. Austin Pasztor
        had a miserable day in Miami, surrendering six pressures and one sack while
        being whistled for three holding penalties plus two illegal procedure fouls.
        Despite the tough performance, Pasztor will start against the Redskins as
        the Browns look for their first victory of the season.\n\n\"He's the best
        we have,\" Cleveland coach Hue Jackson said. \"Anytime a guy gives up multiple
        sacks and has a few penalties, I think everybody thinks that the guy's not
        playing as well. Were there some times that we could've helped him a little
        more? Yes, there's no question we could have.\n\n\"But I think Austin Pasztor
        is battling as hard as he can, and I think he's still the right choice for
        us over at right tackle. Will I adjust our scheme a little bit to do some
        things to help him? Yeah, but I wish you guys could see some of the other
        things that he is doing that balance some of the things that he's not doing
        as well.\"\n\nJackson said rookie offensive linemen Shon Coleman, a third-round
        pick from Auburn, and Spencer Drango, a fifth-round pick from Baylor, are
        not ready to take Pasztor's spot.\n\nEven that isn't the end of the problems
        on the offensive line. Alvin Bailey, a backup the first two weeks, started
        at right guard against the Dolphins when Greco moved to center.  Bailey was
        arrested and charged with OVI plus possession of drug paraphernalia about
        four hours after the team flight from Miami landed in Cleveland.\n\nBailey
        faces team and possible league discipline. He told police he was drinking
        on the plane, which is a violation of both team and NFL rules. For now, Bailey
        will start at right guard against the Redskins.\n\nThere are issues on the
        other side of the ball as well. The Browns are hopeful left cornerback Joe
        Haden can play against the Redskins. He suffered a groin injury in practice
        last Thursday and did not play against the Dolphins. Miami quarterback Ryan
        Tannehill took advantage of Haden's absence and threw three touchdown passes.\n\nHaden
        practiced Wednesday after saying an hour before practice that he wouldn't.
        Haden normally follows the opponent's best receiver, and in the case of the
        Redskins, that likely would mean DeSean Jackson. Jackson is averaging 17 yards
        a catch. Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins has three touchdown passes.\n\nThe
        Browns are also hopeful strong safety Ibraheim Campbell has healed from a
        hamstring injury and can play against the Redskins. Campbell was inactive
        against the Dolphins and did not practice Wednesday.        \n\n--Sunday's
        game versus the Washington Redskins was supposed to be the big game where
        quarterback Robert Griffin III led the Browns against his former team, but
        that won't happen. \n\nGriffin will be on the sideline in street clothes and
        likely wearing a sling on his left arm. He suffered a broken bone in his left
        shoulder in the opener and is on injured reserve.\n\n--Browns rookie wide
        receiver Corey Coleman is confident he will be back before midseason after
        sustaining a broken right hand in practice last week. \n\nColeman was injured
        when he caught a pass and got hit by a safety. His finger caught on the defender's
        pads and bent backward. He continued practicing and did not realize his hand
        was broken.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" he said in the locker room on Monday. \"It
        didn't hurt or anything. That's a blessing that I don't have to have surgery.
        Now it's just waiting time.\"\n\nColeman has seven catches for 173 yards and
        two touchdowns.\n\n--The Redskins were defending Super Bowl champions when
        the Browns beat them, 17-13, on Nov. 27, 1988, in a steady rain at RFK Stadium.
        \n\nEarnest Byner ran 27 yards to score the winning touchdown with 1:49 to
        play. The Browns outscored the Redskins, 14-3, in the fourth quarter.  \n\nA
        one-yard touchdown run by Kevin Mack earlier in the period tied the score
        10-10.\n\n--Browns running back Isaiah Crowell is tied for second in the NFL
        with 274 rushing yards. Going back to last season, he has five rushing touchdowns
        in his last seven games. \n\nThe Browns will be counting on him heavily again
        on Sunday against the Redskins. \n\nCrowell is not satisfied because the Browns
        are 0-3. \n\n\"For me, personally, I have to work on pass protection and running
        harder,\" he said. \"That's the main thing I want to do.\"\n\n--Browns sparkplug
        Terrelle Pryor can do it all on the offensive side of the ball, but the 27-year-old
        showed he is capable of capturing the spotlight with his words as well.\n\nAlthough
        his team is winless after its first three games, Pryor told reporters that
        he feels his team is close to turning the corner.\n\n\"We're so close to getting

        we get over that hump, I think we're going to have a lot of success, even
        this year. ... I think we can win all the rest of the games. It depends on
        our mindset. It depends on how we look at it. It's just one week at a time.\"\n\nPryor
        kept a positive outlook on Sunday, as he reeled in eight receptions for 144
        yards, rushed four times for 21 yards and also completed three of his five
        passes.]]>\n      </long>\n    </content>\n    <refs>\n      <ref sportradar_id=\"d5a2eb42-8065-4174-ab79-0a6fa820e35e\"

        with the New York Jets and appeared in 45 games, averaging 45.1 yards, with
        71 punts landing inside the 20-yard line. He spent the preseason with Jacksonville
        after signing with the Jaguars on June 16 but was released on Aug. 29. He
        entered the NFL with the Chicago Bears in 2012 as an undrafted rookie free
        agent out of Boston College but was released at the end of the preseason.\n\nThe
        Cardinals also signed linebacker Joplo Bartu and long snapper Aaron Brewer,
        and placed linebacker Alani Fua on injured reserve with a knee injury. Fua
        had just one tackle in three games this season. \n\nThe 6-foot-2, 239-pound
        Bartu has played in 41 career games (26 starts) in three seasons in the NFL
        with Atlanta and Jacksonville and has 203 tackles, 4.5 sacks, two passes defensed
        and two fumble recoveries. He originally entered the league with the Falcons
        as an undrafted rookie in 2013 out of Texas State and went on to play in all
        16 games (12 starts) in his first season and had a career-high 100 tackles.
        He played in all 16 games (13 starts) in 2014 and had 92 tackles before splitting
        the 2015 season between Atlanta (six games) and Jacksonville (three games).
        Bartu spent the preseason with the Jaguars until he was released on Aug. 29.

        in a 53-yard touchdown return in the Buffalo Bills' 33-18 win.\n\nBrewer snapped
        in all 64 regular-season games and eight postseason contests the past four
        seasons with Denver, including the Broncos' victory in Super Bowl 50. He entered

        are just glad it won't be Brady at QB]]>\n    </title>\n    <byline>The Sports

        \   <content>\n      <long>\n        <![CDATA[ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- The Buffalo
        Bills have a somewhat tricky week of planning and practicing in front of them
        because there remains some mystery regarding who will be the starting quarterback
        for New England on Sunday at Gillette Stadium.\n\nJimmy Garoppolo, who sustained
        a shoulder injury in Week 2 against Miami, and Jacoby Brissett, who suffered
        a thumb injury in Week 3 against Houston, both are practicing, but there's
        no indication of which one might get the call against Buffalo.\n\nAll Ryan
        knows is that Tom Brady won't be out there, and that's fine with him.\n\n\"You've
        got the best quarterback in history, and these guys are good, but I don't
        know if they'll rank quite up there with Tom Brady,\" coach Rex Ryan said
        Wednesday of Brady, who is the final week of his four-game suspension stemming
        from the Deflategate scandal.\n\nThere is a perception that Ryan has always
        fared well against Brady, but it's not really true. \n\nSince Ryan became
        a head coach in 2009, first with the New York Jets and now with the Bills,
        Brady has completed 60.1 percent of his passes and has averaged 282 yards
        passing per game with 27 touchdowns and eight interceptions against his teams.
        \n\nAmong quarterbacks who have played at least five game against Ryan, Brady's
        91.2 quarterback rating is the best. \n\nTo be fair, Brady has regularly tortured
        every opponent he has faced, although none more so than the Bills. \n\nSince
        Brady became New England's quarterback in 2001, the Patriots have won 27 of
        30 games against Buffalo, and one of the losses came in 2014 in the season
        finale when Brady only a quarter and the game was finished by none other than
        Garoppolo, then a rookie.\n\nRyan said he thinks he knows who will play, but
        no matter who it ends up being, the Bills aren't altering their preparation
        all that much because the basic tenets of the New England offense aren't going
        to be that much different.\n\n\"The passing game is the passing game, New
        England hasn't changed its passing attack, so all that stays the same,\" Ryan
        said of the Patriots' maddeningly effective short-to-intermediate scheme.
        \n\n\"The rushing attack, let's just say there's going to be more options
        and all that. The main thing is just stopping what they do.\"\n\nRyan is willing
        to deal with that uncertainty because the bottom line is that Brady will be
        watching from his living room couch. \n\n\"They're going to game plan specific
        for the quarterback, so we understand that and we'll be prepared,\" Ryan said.
        \"It might take a little more time than normally what it would, but I'd rather
        do that than face Tom Brady, so I'm OK with it.\"\n\nThe Bills know who their
        quarterback is going to be, and if they are going to pull off the upset, Tyrod
        Taylor has to be more effective than he has been the first three weeks of
        the season. \n\nLast week in the win over Arizona, Taylor passed for only
        119 yards, and the Bills have to get more from their passing game, especially
        against an opponent like New England.\n\nOne thing coach Bill Belichick pf
        the Patriots specializes in is taking away a team's primary strength, and
        there's no doubt that with wide receiver Sammy Watkins possibly out again,
        the Bills will have to rely on LeSean McCoy and their running game. \n\nIf
        the Patriots shut that down, Taylor has to have a big game.\n\n\"Our passing
        attack, we haven't had a whole lot of success,\" Ryan said. \"We've thrown
        some deep balls which is good, but we need to be more consistent in the passing
        game.\"\n\nSERIES HISTORY: 113th regular-season meeting. Patriots lead, 69-42-1.
        New England has beaten up on the Bills like no team ever has, winning 23 of
        the last 25. The Patriots are 14-1 all-time at Gillette Stadium against the
        Bills. The only Buffalo victory came in 2014 when Tom Brady played only the
        first quarter and was replaced by Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\n--One of the keys to
        the Bills' sterling defensive performance against the Arizona Cardinals was
        the use of seven defensive backs in several packages which had Arizona quarterback
        Carson Palmer confused. The Bills sacked Palmer five times and intercepted
        four of his passes -- two by Stephon Gilmore and one each by Corey White and
        Corey Graham.\n\nCoach Rex Ryan said he has used seven defensive backs in
        the past, but what made this different is that he had four safeties on the
        field -- Aaron Williams, Corey Graham, Duke Williams, and Robert Blanton.
        \n\n\"I don't think we have ever used the four safeties, though,\" Ryan said.
        \"That was something I thought would give us a better opportunity to free
        someone up, maybe change the count up a little bit. So it worked out pretty
        good. \n\n\"A lot of pressure on the back end to learn those spots and quite
        honestly, we were going to have Colt Anderson back up a bunch of things, but
        then he couldn't go later in the week. Our guys did a really good job mentally
        in preparing for that system.\"\n\n--Throughout his head coaching career,
        Rex Ryan has always called the plays on defense, but he said last Sunday that
        he turned those duties, for the most part, over to defensive coordinator Dennis
        Thurman. Ryan said he let his former defensive coordinator in New York, Mike
        Pettine, call plays on occasion as well, but this seemed a bit different because
        Ryan has always said he's the guy making the calls on game day.\n\n\"I was
        doing more of the head coach deal like everybody else, I think,\" Ryan said.
        \"So that was, when the offense had the ball, I was on the offensive headset
        and same thing with the defense and even special teams. I just started to
        do that a little bit more. \n\n\"I want everybody to understand that the responsibility
        is the same regardless of who the play caller is. My input is going to be
        all over that, so I don't want all of a sudden the criticism to be, 'Oh it's
        Dennis Thurman.' No, it's not. It is my defense, it has always been my defense,
        and that is the way it will be.\"\n\nNOTES: QB Tyrod Taylor's 77 passes are
        the fewest of any quarterback who has started three games this season. ...
        RB LeSean McCoy, who had 110 rushing yards against the Cardinals, ranks 10th
        in the NFL in rushing with 227 yards. ... RB/PR Reggie Bush did not play last
        week, and he has been on the field for only six snaps this season. ... WR
        Marquise Goodwin has scored only four touchdowns in his NFL career, but the
        average length of the scores in 56.5 yards. ... S Aaron Williams scored the
        first touchdown of his six-year NFL career, although it came on special teams,
        as he scooped a bad long snap and ran 53 yards to the end zone against Arizona.
        ... LB Preston Brown totaled 20 tackles, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery
        in two games against the Patriots last year. ...LB Zach Brown leads the Bills
        34 tackles and that ties him for the NFL lead. ... K Dan Carpenter remains
        the Bills' all-time leader in field goal accuracy (88.5 percent) with only
        12 misses in 105 attempts, but he has missed seven extra points since the
        line was pushed back to the 33. ... T Cyrus Koaundjio sat out practice Wednesday
        because of an ankle injury and he may be questionable for the Patriots game.
        ... OL Michael Ola was signed off the Giants practice squad, mostly as insurance
        because both Cordy Glenn and Cyrus Kouandjio are slowed by ankle injuries.
        ... TE Charles Clay continues to be bothered by a sore knee and he did not
        practice Wednesday.]]>\n      </long>\n    </content>\n    <refs>\n      <ref

        we're going to be comfortable with whatever decision is made. It's just kind

        -- Before the season started, a 2-1 record without the best running back in
        the NFL seemed like a reasonable goal to achieve. \n\nBut after the Pittsburgh
        Steelers were blown out, 34-3, in Philadelphia on Sunday, a 2-1 record is
        raising all kinds of questions about a team that was supposed to be a strong
        AFC contender for the Super Bowl. \n\nOne thing the Steelers have that other
        AFC teams don't in Week 4 is the addition of Le'Veon Bell, who will start
        against the Kansas City Chiefs after missing the first three games due to
        a drug suspension. \n\nWhen healthy and available, Bell is regarded by many
        as the best all-around running back in the NFL. In his 2014 All-Pro season,
        Bell rushed for 1,361 yards and caught 83 passes for 854 yards. \n\nLast season,
        he rushed for 556 yards in the six games for which he dressed and had a 4.9
        yards-per-carry average before a knee injury ended his season in Week 8. \n\nWith
        the offense coming off a poor performance in Philadelphia you can expect Bell
        to get a heavy workload in his first game back. Coach Mike Tomlin said as
        much earlier this week. \n\n\"We're going to let practice be our guide in
        terms of that division of labor, but his level of conditioning is not a concern
        to us,\" Tomlin said. \"He's a guy who is highly conditioned over a 12-month
        calendar. We've seen him every day, he's been a part of us, he's been in the
        building, and he's up to speed on what we're doing from a schematic standpoint
        and really in tune there. \n\n\"We'll see how sharp he is physically once
        we get him out on the practice field and kind of go from there. But, rest
        assured you're going to see Le'Veon Bell, and probably a lot of him on Sunday.\"\n\nBackup
        running back DeAngelo Williams played well in Bell's place, despite rushing
        for only 21 yards against the Eagles. But if last season is any indicator,
        Williams won't see a lot of action with Bell back in the lineup. \n\nWhen
        Bell returned from a two-game suspension last season, Williams barely touched
        the ball in the six games Bell played before he was injured. In those six
        games, Williams had 21 carries and nine of those came in the game Bell was
        injured. \n\nOne thing that might change Williams' usage this season is the
        murky situation at receiver. \n\nEli Rogers is questionable for Sunday's game
        against the Chiefs due to a turf toe injury. With Markus Wheaton coming off
        a bad game and Sammie Coates still trying to find his niche in the offense,
        coordinator Todd Haley could get creative and play with Bell and Williams.
        \n\nHaley could align both in the backfield and then shift Bell outside to
        receiver, where the Chiefs defense must account for him in the passing game.
        Bell is known as the best receiving back in the league. \n\n\"I want to be
        a guy who is reliable,\" Bell said. \"I want to make sure I take care of the
        football, make plays on situational downs, get into the end zone and help
        the offense move the ball and win games. That's what I feel like I can do
        and I look forward to it.\"\n\nBell has faced Kansas City twice in his career.
        In a 2014 meeting at Heinz Field, the Chiefs held him to 73 total yards (63
        rushing and nine receiving). Last season, Bell rushed for 121 yards and caught
        four passes for 16 yards in a 23-13 loss at Arrowhead Stadium. \n\nSERIES
        HISTORY: The Steelers lead the series, 20-10. They beat Kansas City three
        consecutive times before losing to the Chiefs, 23-13, at Arrowhead Stadium
        last season. The Steelers are 10-4 against the Chiefs at home. The previous
        time the Chiefs won in Pittsburgh was Dec. 21, 1986. This is the fourth time
        in the past five years the Chiefs have played at Heinz Field. \n\n--With starting
        safety Robert Golden (hamstring) and starting slot corner Sean Davis (back)
        questionable for the Chiefs game as they deal with injuries, the Steelers
        will give some reserves that haven't seen much playing time a chance to get
        some valuable practice time this week. \n\nShamarko Thomas is a candidate
        to play safety and Justin Gilbert, who was acquired in a trade with Cleveland
        before the season, is a candidate to play cornerback. Gilbert has spent the
        first three weeks getting used to a new defensive playbook. \n\n\"He's past
        the learning what to do stage now, he's moving onto the critical element of
        gaining enough detail to be successful where we're comfortable and he's comfortable,\"
        coach Mike Tomlin said. \"I like the progress he's made thus far though.\"\n\nThomas
        fell way down the depth chart after he lost the starting strong safety job
        in the summer of 2015. \n\nGolden earned the job in the spring and Davis is
        the future starter there, but Thomas, who is in the final season of his rookie
        contract, might get another opportunity to prove he can play. \n\n--Coach
        Mike Tomlin left his starters in the game to the bitter end of the 34-3 loss
        to the Eagles on Sunday. That meant his two most indispensable players --
        quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and All-Pro receiver Antonio Brown -- were
        playing meaningless snaps when the game was out of reach. For that, he has
        received some criticism. \n\n\"There are always a couple schools of thought
        and ways you can go there,\" Tomlin said. \"I've always been one to be slow
        to acknowledge defeat and the acceptance of defeat. I take responsibility
        for those guys remaining in the game and I always do and will. \n\n\"It's
        just something that we do. We play and we play to win. We understand that
        injuries are a part of football, but we don't let that fear be our guide in
        terms of decision making. That's generally our approach across the board,
        regardless of what subject or circumstance you're talking about.\"\n\nRoethlisberger
        said he wouldn't have come out of the game even if Tomlin had tried to out
        in backup Landry Jones. \n\n\"You've been around me long enough to know I'm
        not (leaving the game),\" Roethlisberger said. \"Even if Coach would've said
        'Get out' I would've kept going in. We don't quit. I don't quit. That's not
        the Steeler way. That's not my way.\"\n\nNOTES: LB Ryan Shazier, who aggravated

        Packers coach Mike McCarthy and his assistants don't have much to go on as
        they huddle to assess the state of their team with the players away through
        the weekend for the bye.\n\nThe small sample size of three games, however,
        has revealed plenty about how the Packers have functioned thus far.\n\nMcCarthy
        referred to a self-scouting nugget that came out of a chat he had with quarterback
        Aaron Rodgers in a meeting on Monday, prior to the coach excusing the players
        for the rest of the week.\n\n\"This is the first time in my career here that
        our run game is ahead of our pass game,\" said McCarthy, who is in his 11th
        year as Packers coach.\n\nThe statistics are telling of the early body of
        work by both the offense and the defense. \n\nAs they sit idly by with a 2-1
        record until they resume playing on Oct. 9 against the New York Giants at
        Lambeau Field, the Packers' nearly annual strengths of throwing the football
        and defending it through the air have shown to be weaknesses. \n\nGreen Bay's
        passing offense ranks 29th out of the NFL's 32 teams with an average of 193.3
        yards per game. That woeful output received a slight boost Sunday, when Rodgers
        bounced back from an atrocious performance the previous week and threw four
        touchdown passes in the 34-27 win over the Detroit Lions.\n\n\"It feels good
        to see some of the potential,\" said Rodgers, who delivered all of the scoring
        strikes in the first half as the Packers raced out to a 31-3 lead, their most
        points before halftime since December 2014.\n\nHowever, Green Bay wound up
        relying on its somewhat better half - the rushing attack - to keep the Lions
        at bay as they mounted a big comeback to get within seven points late in the
        game. Punishing back Eddie Lacy pounded away for 103 yards in 17 carries,
        his first 100-yard game of the season.\n\nThat helped send the Packers past
        the century mark for season average with 100.3 rushing yards per game, good
        for 17th in the league.\n\n\"I definitely think we responded in the right
        way (Sunday), and it gives us a glimpse of how good we can be once we're on
        the same page,\" Lacy said. \"It just gives us confidence and lets us know
        that if we have to run the ball we can definitely do so.\"\n\nMeanwhile, opponents
        are quickly discovering that running the ball against Green Bay's defense
        may be a no-win proposition.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars, Minnesota Vikings
        and the Lions rushed for all of 128 yards - combined - when they played the
        Packers. The team said it's the fifth-fewest rushing yards allowed by an NFL
        team after three games since 1980.\n\nGreen Bay not only is a runaway leader
        in the league with an average of 42.7 rushing yards allowed, but it also ranks
        first by allowing only one run of 10 or more yards. The Packers are giving
        up an average of just 1.8 yards per running play, also No. 1 in the league.\n\nConversely,
        the Green Bay pass defense has been torched for an average of 307.3 yards
        per game, ranking 28th.\n\nPlaying without four starters Sunday, including
        linebacker Clay Matthews and the secondary duo of cornerback Sam Shields and
        Morgan Burnett, the Packers surrendered 385 passing yards and three touchdowns
        to the Lions' Matthew Stafford.\n\n\"Our pass rush has always been outstanding
        the last couple of years, and we've had some challenges with the players being
        injured and so forth, but our run defense is ahead of our pass defense right
        now,\" McCarthy said. \"We understand that. It's a focus of ours, and that's
        the beauty of this game. We'll work on that, and it'll be a big part of our
        game planning and emphases as we go into the Giants' game.\"]]>\n      </long>\n

        \   <content>\n      <long>\n        <![CDATA[An appearance on \"Dancing with
        the Stars\" may not be in his future, but Nick Perry is fast on the heels
        of one of the football players who had a long run on the popular ABC reality
        show.\n\nPerry leads the Green Bay Packers with 3 1/2 sacks after three games.
        That ranks him fourth in the NFL. Topping the list is fellow outside linebacker
        Von Miller of the Denver Broncos. Miller has five sacks.\n\nPerry's most prolific
        start in five seasons as a pro featured a career-high-tying two sacks in Green
        Bay's home opener Sunday, a 34-27 win over the Detroit Lions. Perry also batted
        down a pass from Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford and was credited by the
        coaches with nine tackles, which matched his personal best and included a
        career-high eight solo tackles.\n\n\"Nick Perry's been a monster on that side.
        (I'm) proud of him,\" Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. \n\nAfter the
        Packers re-signed Perry to a one-year deal worth $5 million at the outset
        of free agency in March, he looks to finally be living up his first-round
        draft status in 2012 after injuries sidetracked him the last four years.\n\n\"Some
        guys develop a little bit later than others,\" veteran linebacker Julius Peppers
        said. \"I feel like he's finally getting comfortable in his role on the team
        and (has) a lot of opportunities to go out there and make plays, and he's
        responding well.\"\n\nPerry began the season in the starting lineup, assuming
        the role previously held by Peppers opposite Clay Matthews in Green Bay's
        base defense. Defensive coordinator Dom Capers made the notable switch in
        the offseason as a way to preserve the 36-year-old Peppers for pass-rush situations.\n\n\"I
        think that's been working out really well for us,\" Peppers said of Perry's
        bigger role. \"He's been a big part of the success we've been having on defense
        this year.\"\n\nAs Perry looked forward to a week of relaxation with the Packers'
        having an early bye on their schedule, he's hopeful he can hold up for the
        entire season. Perry has never played a full season as a pro and already is
        on the verge of surpassing his career-best total of four sacks in 2013.\n\n\"I
        just want to be able to enjoy the game,\" Perry said. \"Right now, I think
        I'm enjoying it as best as I can. I'm available, and I'm out there just having
        fun.\"\n\nDefensive tackle Mike Daniels says availability has made a huge
        difference for Perry, who ranks third on the team with 17 tackles. Perry's
        season high is 42 in 2013.\n\n\"I always said, if Nick stays healthy, he's
        going to kick some tail,\" Daniels said. \"You can see it. He finally looks
        comfortable out there. I'm excited for him. I'm happy for him, and I'm looking
        forward to seeing him continue to grow. I just love seeing his progress.\"\n\n--Perry's
        big game Sunday incidentally started in dubious fashion.\n\nAfter he ripped
        down running back Theo Riddick on an outside run play for a 1-yard loss on
        the Lions' second play of the game, Perry celebrated by making a throat-slash
        gesture. That drew a 15-yard unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty.\n\n\"Emotional
        play,\" Perry said afterward. \"I don't really know what I was doing out there.\"\n\nPerry
        took responsibility for the action, which negated a huge stop on second-and-long
        for Detroit.\n\n\"It's something you learn from ... and down the road, you
        just don't make mistakes like that again,\" he said. \"I made a mistake. I
        own it.\"\n\n--The Packers and the Philadelphia Eagles are the teams with
        the earliest bye week this season.\n\nGreen Bay also had its bye in Week 4
        during the 2013 season.\n\nThe Packers return to action Oct. 9 with a Sunday
        night game against the New York Giants at Lambeau Field. It will be the third
        straight year Green Bay plays its first game after the bye on Sunday night.]]>\n

        Colts may be playing a road game on Sunday against AFC South rival Jacksonville,
        but in terms of preparation, Colts head coach Chuck Pagano is treating the
        divisional matchup with the Jaguars just like it a short week game.\n\nWhat
        with trying to give his players enough time to revive and recoup after last
        week's home win over San Diego while also preparing to play an overseas game
        against the Jaguars, the challenges are daunting.\n\n\"The theme is to keep
        the main thing the main thing and that's preparation. Prepare, do everything,
        try to keep things as normal as possible from a preparation standpoint and
        practice standpoint,\" Pagano stressed this week.\n\n\"You have to make a
        few adjustments here and there. But at the end of the day it's focus and mindset
        on one thing and one thing only, and that is getting win number two.\"\n\nThe
        Colts and Jaguars already know each other pretty well as divisional opponents
        since the start of the 2002 season. That helps a lot when it comes to game
        planning.\n\nTrying to get enough meaningful practice time in while also attempting
        to get enough rest for what will be an eight-hour plane trip has been the
        issue. That's the balancing act that Pagano, his coaching staff and the team's
        athletic training staff has been trying to navigate.\n\n\"We will travel Thursday
        evening and get in there early Friday morning at 6:30 a.m. and be at the hotel
        by 9 a.m.,\" the Colts coach explained.\n\n\"We will begin to keep those guys
        up and get on the practice field. We have another practice, actually two more
        practices over there, so we have bonus days so we will have plenty of time
        to prepare.\"\n\nThat being said, Pagano has confidence in his team's ability
        to adjust to whatever might pop up during its business trip to London.\n\n\"This
        team is prepared to handle anything that comes its way,\" the Colts coach
        stressed. \"This team is prepared to win any type of ball game that we have
        to win. I'm counting on another close one. (Jacksonville) is a good football
        team.\n\n\"Throw the records out. They have a bunch of great players on that
        team. They have great skill, they have a quarterback that can beat you and
        a defense that is loaded with talent and speed. They have speed all over the
        place. They are well coached in all three phases.\"\n\nDespite all the logistics
        involved in making a trip to London, Pagano is more concerned about any issues
        that may come up during Sunday's game. Despite the Jaguars' 0-3 record, he
        knows that it wouldn't be a good idea to overlook Jacksonville.\n\n\"You just
        go back and look at the last games and you look at what happened our last
        time down in Jacksonville (a 51-16 loss),\" the Colts coach said. \"We will
        be prepared to try to battle and win any type of game that comes our way.\"\n\nAndrew
        Luck spent much of his youth in London as his father Oliver was the president
        of NFL Europe. Addison Luck, Andrew's younger brother, was born in London.\n\nLuck
        was pleased when he found out that the Colts would be playing a regular season
        game in London.\n\n\"I was excited,\" Luck said. \"I was excited mostly for
        my extended family that has never seen me play. We definitely have fond memories
        over there. I loved my childhood over there.\"]]>\n      </long>\n    </content>\n

        MILLS, Md. -- Baltimore coach John Harbaugh says the Ravens' offense is poised
        to emerge from an early slump. \n\nThe team will likely have to find a way
        to score more touchdowns this week with a potential a shootout looming against
        the high-powered Oakland Raiders. \n\nThe Ravens are 3-0 for the third time
        in franchise history (2006 and 2009) with the wins coming by a combined 13
        points. Baltimore has managed only four touchdowns over that stretch.\n\nOakland,
        meanwhile, has the second-best offense in the NFL, averaging 436 yards and
        26.7 points per game. As a result, the Ravens and their 25th-ranked offense
        might have to pave the way for a victory. \n\n\"I am confident that the touchdowns
        are going to come,\" Harbaugh said. \"I really do believe that we will get
        there. You have to do what you have to do to win a game. \n\n\"If we had been
        able to score touchdowns in that game, it would not have come down to what
        it came down to. We need to score touchdowns, and I am very confident that
        we can get there with our offense. I don't think that we are far away.\"\n\nOne
        of the keys for the Ravens will be to get more production from their running
        game. Terrance West and Justin Forsett have split time but neither has been
        effective, averaging only 3.3 yards per carry. \n\nWhile the Ravens would
        like to strike with big plays, quarterback Joe Flacco said the running game
        is vital to success.\n\n\"If we can get some chunks in the running game and
        start moving the ball that way, it will make it easier for us to start putting
        the ball into the end zone,\" said Flacco, who has the team's only rushing
        touchdown. \"We need to do it.\"\n\nWhile the offense has struggled, the Ravens'
        defense has come up big each game. Baltimore is allowing only 254.3 yards
        per game, second only to Seattle (250.3). \n\nThis is a big improvement from
        last season, when the Ravens failed to make key stops in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"I
        do believe we are a better defense,\" Harbaugh said. \"Bottom line is being
        better. It's not that we didn't want to stop people last year, we were not
        good enough to get it done. \n\n\"This year we're playing well enough to get
        it done. We are a better defense. We can't discount the fact we learned some
        tough lessons last year and our leaders are doing a good job of instilling
        that into our younger players.\" \n\nThe defense will face its biggest test
        this week against Derek Carr, who has passed for 867 yards with five touchdowns
        and one interception. In last season's matchup, Carr had a career-high 351
        yards with three touchdowns in a 37-33 victory. He threw the game-winning
        score to Seth Roberts with 26 seconds left.  \n\nBaltimore is looking for
        a measure of revenge on Sunday. The team could get a boost if linebacker Terrell
        Suggs is able to make his season debut. \n\n\"They're very well coached,\"
        Harbaugh said of the Raiders. \"They have tons of talented (players) -- very,
        very talented team with a lot of top 10 picks. They're going to be really
        good. They're a contender in the AFC, and we're looking forward to playing
        them.\"\n\nSERIES HISTORY: Ninth regular-season meeting. Ravens lead the series,
        6-2. Baltimore won four consecutive games in the series before last year,
        when Oakland escaped with a 37-33 victory. An interception by safety Will
        Hill appeared to seal the win for Baltimore. However, the Ravens were called
        for holding. Oakland quarterback Derek Carr then threw a game-winning 12-yard
        touchdown to Seth Roberts. The Ravens beat Oakland 16-3 in the 2000 AFC Championship
        en route to their first Super Bowl victory. \n\n--Ravens linebacker C.J. Mosley
        has taken on a bigger leadership role. He is tasked with calling plays for
        the defense and has gotten better in pass coverage, an area he admittedly
        needed to improve entering the season. \n\nMosley has interceptions in two
        consecutive games, both coming at critical times. Mosley's improvement has
        not been lost on coach John Harbaugh.  \n\n\"He has made some plays in the
        passing game,\" Harbaugh said. \"He has had really good depth -- you look
        at those two interceptions -- (he had) really good depth on his coverage.
        He shows a lot of range, spatial awareness, not jumping routes when he isn't
        supposed to, playing top-down-type of zone coverage; those were both zone
        coverage plays. To go up and get the ball and track the ball (was difficult).
        Those were not easy catches -- either one of them. That was good to see.\"\n\n--As
        the Ravens have struggled to score touchdowns, kicker Justin Tucker has once
        again showed his value to the team.\n\nLast week against Jacksonville, Tucker
        made four field goals from 43, 42, 37 and 54 yards, and that was the difference
        in a 19-17 victory. For the season, he is 9 for 9 on field-goal attempts.\n\nTucker
        agreed to a four-year, $16.8 million contract only hours before the July 15
        deadline for long-term deals for franchise players. While Ravens coach Harbaugh
        values Tucker's contributions, he knows the teams needs to score more touchdowns
        in the red zone as opposed to settling for three points. One of the keys is
        giving quarterback Joe Flacco more time to make plays. \n\n\"We have to get
        there and make a few plays here and there,\" Harbaugh said. \"I don't think
        it is going to be anything dramatic. It is making a play here and there. It
        is popping a run here and there. It is holding off the brush here a little
        longer here and there to give Joe a little longer to make a throw or making
        a catch. Those are things that we can do.\"\n\nNOTES: RB Kenneth Dixon (knee)
        was back on the practice field Wednesday, mostly running on the side. Dixon
        has not played since the third preseason game on Aug. 27 when he sprained
        a knee against the Detroit Lions and his recovery was expected to take about
        a month. His status for the Week 4 game against Oakland is uncertain. ...
        LB Elvis Dumervil (foot) returned to practice Wednesday is expected to make
        his season debut Week 4 against the Oakland Raiders, according to fellow linebacker
        Terrell Suggs. Dumervil had offseason foot surgery and was initially taken
        off the PUP list on Aug. 22. With Suggs healthy, the Ravens should have a
        fierce pass rush. ... LG Alex Lewis, a rookie fourth-round pick from Nebraska,
        had to leave the game in Week 3 against the Jaguars because of a concussion.
        He was still unable to practice Wednesday and his status for game against
        Oakland is uncertain. ... LT Ronnie Stanley (foot) did not practice Wednesday
        and was wearing a walking boot. Stanley also missed practice last week with
        a foot injury but was able to play Sunday against the Jaguars. Stanley status
        for this week against the Raiders is uncertain.]]>\n      </long>\n    </content>\n

        wide receiver Dez Bryant has been diagnosed with a slight hairline fracture
        in his right knee, but the team is hoping he can still play Sunday. \n\nCoach
        Jason Garrett, speaking to reporters Wednesday, confirmed Bryant's injury
        and said \"we're hopeful that he'll be able to play\" against the San Francisco
        49ers. \n\n\"He has a slight hairline fracture in one of the bones of his
        knees,\" Garrett told reporters during a conference call. \"We don't think
        it's something that's going to keep him out for an extended period of time
        but again it's going to be a day-by-day, week-by-week situation.\"\n\nA source
        told ESPN's Adam Schefter that the injury potentially could sideline Bryant
        up to three weeks.\n\n\n\n-- Cincinnati Bengals Pro Bowl tight end Tyler Eifert
        and cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick are listed as doubtful for Thursday game (8:25
        p.m., ET) against the Miami Dolphins at Paul Brown Stadium.\n\nEifert has
        been recovering from an ankle injury sustained in the Pro Bowl. He told reporters
        Tuesday that he had no discomfort coming off his first week of practice since
        offseason ankle surgery.\n\nKirkpatrick has a hamstring injury and likely
        will be replaced in the starting lineup by Darqueze Dennard.\n\n\n\n-- Philadelphia
        Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz and Denver Broncos quarterback Trevor Siemian
        were named Offensive Player of the Week in their respective conferences.   \n\nMinnesota
        Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen took the NFC defensive award after his
        three-sack performance in the 22-10 win over the Carolina Panthers on the
        road.\n\nKansas City Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters had two of the team's
        six interceptions in the 24-3 win over the New York Jets to win the AFC Defensive
        Player of the Week.\n\n\n\n-- The Arizona Cardinals signed veteran punter
        Ryan Quigley to replace the injured Drew Butler.\n\nButler, dealing with an
        ankle and Achilles injury, is still expected to hold for kicker Chandler Catanzaro
        during games.\n\nThe Cardinals also signed linebacker Joplo Bartu and long
        snapper Aaron Brewer, and placed linebacker Alani Fua on injured reserve with
        a knee injury. Fua had just one tackle in three games this season.\n\n\n\n--
        The Washington Redskins signed rookie cornerback Lloyd Carrington to their
        practice squad.\n\nThe undrafted 23-year-old out of Arizona State made quite
        the impression with a one-handed interception during training camp, but was
        released on Sept. 2 before the final round of cuts.\n\nCarrington takes the
        roster spot of linebacker Amarlo Herrera, who was released from the practice
        squad on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n-- The Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed wide receiver
        Jonathan Krause to their practice squad.\n\nThe 5-foot-11, 190-pound Krause,
        who spent the preseason with the Bucs, originally entered the league as a
        college free agent out of Vanderbilt with the Cleveland Browns in 2014. \n\nKrause
        also spent time with the New England Patriots and Philadelphia, playing in
        two games with the Eagles last season and recording two catches for 11 yards.\n\n\n\nThe
        New England Patriots signed defensive lineman Anthony Johnson to their practice
        squad.\n\nJohnson, 23, was released by the Patriots on Monday. He originally
        entered the NFL as a rookie free agent with the Miami Dolphins on May 12,
        2014.\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 295-pound Johnson out of LSU made the Dolphins' 53-man
        roster as a rookie and played in seven games, recording two tackles and recovering
        one fumble. He was released by Miami at the end of training camp in 2015 and
        signed by the Washington Redskins' practice squad in November. Johnson was
        released by Washington on May 2.]]>\n      </long>\n    </content>\n    <provider

        Sullivan looking to start over for Redskins]]>\n    </title>\n    <byline>The

        -- The Washington Redskins needed help at center. John Sullivan needed a job.
        The two made a match this week. \n\nSullivan, 31, a long-time starting center
        for the Minnesota Vikings, was cut on Aug. 30. Two back surgeries ruined his
        2015 season and Sullivan lost the competition. \n\nUnable to trade him, the
        Vikings cut him instead. Just like, that an offensive line mainstay was gone.
        Sullivan started 93 of 96 games there between 2009 and 2014. \n\n\"I got to
        say, before the back injury I thought I could play through anything,\" Sullivan
        said. \"And I had played through a lot. It's not that you never get injured
        if you start a lot of games in a row, it's that you put up with a lot of BS.
        I thought I could play through anything and I was wrong.\"  \n\nThe Redskins
        lost starting center Kory Lichtensteiger on Sunday to a calf injury. Initially
        described as a moderate strain and a \"week-to-week\" injury, the team instead
        put Lichtensteiger on Injured Reserve Tuesday. \n\nFor now, backup offensive
        linemen Spencer Long is the starting center. He spent the entire offseason
        both competing for the starting job at left guard and taking all second-team
        repetitions at center. \n\nLong probably will start Sunday's game against
        the Cleveland Browns. But Sullivan will be up to speed quickly in case he's
        needed. \n\n\"We're going to get (Sullivan) ready to play,\" Redskins coach
        Jay Gruden said. \"We like that he's played center for a long time and has
        been very successful, that's No. 1 for a true center. \n\n\"If need be, when
        he comes in there if something happens to Spencer, he will be ready to go.
        He's a very bright guy and will help this football team in the long run.\"\n\nSullivan
        didn't leave town after visiting Washington's headquarters in suburban Virginia
        on Monday and signing with the Redskins on Tuesday. He simply went right to
        team meetings. \n\n\"Honestly, it feels like I'm back in training camp trying
        to learn an offense,\" Sullivan said. \"Spending a lot of time in the facility
        and staying at a hotel room close by. So it's a little bit different, but
        still exciting all the same.\"  \n\nSERIES HISTORY: The 46th meeting between
        two original NFL franchises. Cleveland leads the all-time series 33-11-1.
        The Redskins have won three of the last four games, however, including a 38-21
        victory on Dec. 16, 2012, notable for being quarterback Kirk Cousins' first
        career start.  \n\n--Rookie wide receiver Josh Doctson (left Achilles tendon)
        was not at practice on Wednesday. Doctson is a major concern now. The first-round
        draft pick missed almost the entire offseason and training camp because of
        the injury. He returned for the first two games against Pittsburgh and Dallas
        and had two receptions, but was a last-second scratch before Sunday's game
        against the New York Giants.  \n\n\"(Doctson) just didn't feel comfortable,
        couldn't push off the way he wanted to so we made the last-minute switch,\"
        Redskins coach Jay Gruden said. \"We don't know. We're trying different treatments
        for him to try and get him back in action as soon as possible, but take it
        easy this week, next couple of days, and see if he can do anything Friday
        and where he is at.\" \n\n--Look out for rookie cornerback Kendall Fuller
        on Sunday. With slot cornerback Dashaun Phillips probably out, Fuller is expected
        to play a big role against the Browns. Washington's third-round pick this
        past spring, Fuller recovered quicker than the team thought from microfracture
        knee surgery and competed for the starting role with Phillips. His play improved
        noticeably late in the preseason, but Washington didn't have a spot for him
        with six cornerbacks on the roster. Now, Fuller has a chance to shine. \n\n\"Some
        guys go down, some guys got to step up,\" Fuller said. \"That's just football,
        that's just life in general...The competitor side of me is gonna say of course
        I was ready to go (in Week 1). But we didn't want to rush the knee. People
        saw me making plays in preseason, but didn't see what it took for me to get
        on the field during the week.\"    \n\n--Kicker Dustin Hopkins was named NFC
        special teams player of the week on Wednesday. He's been a fine pickup since
        Washington signed him early last season. \n\nHopkins made five field goals
        in Sunday's 29-27 win over the New York Giants and was credited by several
        teammates for the win. He is 11-for-11 this season and has hit three of those
        from beyond 30 yards and five more from beyond 40. \n\nNOTES: C Kory Lichtensteiger
        was placed on Injured Reserve on Tuesday because of a calf strain. He is the
        fourth Washington starter placed on IR since the start of training camp. ...
        DE Kendall Reyes missed the last two games because of a groin injury, but
        he returned to practice on Wednesday and could play this Sunday against Cleveland.
        \ ... LB Trent Murphy spent all offseason gaining weight for a switch to defensive
        end. But injuries early in training camp scuttled that idea. Now back as a
        reserve outside linebacker, Murphy leads the Redskins with three sacks.]]>\n

        -- Even in what qualified as a relatively off day through three weeks of the
        season, the Raiders look qualified to make a run at a playoff berth.\n\nA
        17-10 win over the Tennessee Titans was unimpressive other than the final
        result and a 2-1 record.\n\nOne of the most anemic running games in recent
        years has given way to a power-running team that is ranked No. 2 in the NFL
        at 148.3 yards per game through two games.\n\nAn early sample size, but not
        bad, considering the Raiders were ranked No. 28 last season in rushing and
        that their second-leading rusher was quarterback Derek Carr.\n\nA year ago,
        in 16 games, the Raiders' second-leading rusher among running backs was fullback
        Jamize Olawale with 110 yards on 24 carries. The second-leading rusher overall
        was Carr, with 138 yards.\n\nFast forward, and through three games, the Raiders
        already have three backs over last year's 110 yards by Olawale -- Murray with
        153 yards, undrafted rookie free agent Jalen Richard with 129 yards and fifth-round
        draft pick DeAndre Washington with 117.\n\nMurray gained 1,066 yards and had
        nearly 72 percent of the Raiders' rushing attempts in 2015. Now it's a three-headed
        monster, and the Raiders are averaging 5.9 yards per carry.\n\n\"I haven't
        seen anything like it since I've been here,\" Olawale said. \"The whole attitude,
        the mindset, the coaches putting us in the right positions. You can't help
        but be successful.\"\n\nRaiders coach Jack Del Rio has been pleased with an
        offensive line coached by Mike Tice, which has weathered injuries and been
        tweaked by game-by-game yet still remained effective.\n\nIn Week 1, starting
        right tackle Menelik Watson had a groin injury and was replaced by Matt McCants,
        who left because of a knee injury. Donald Penn, who had been an exclusively
        a left tackle since he began his career in 2006, finished out the game on
        the right side.\n\nIn Week 2, Austin Howard, a 13-game starter in 2015, recovered
        from an ankle injury to play every snap against the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nExcept
        the effort took so much out of Howard that he was inactive for Game 3. Watson
        returned, but left with a lower leg injury. That left Vadal Alexander, a seventh-round
        draft pick out of LSU, to take over at right tackle.\n\nFor those keeping
        score -- that's five players at right tackle: Watson, McCants, Penn, Howard
        and Alexander.\n\nIn making those moves, the Raiders were forced to move left
        guard Kelechi Osemele from left guard to left tackle and put Jon Feliciano
        at left guard. That's a lot of moving parts.\n\n\"I like the way our lineman
        have been able to plug in and play,\" coach Jack Del Rio said. \"We had our
        fifth guy at right tackle and were able to move the ball and function. That's
        good stuff. And all our running backs are getting opportunities to carry it.\n\n\"Last
        year, I got a lot of questions about whether we were going to develop a guy
        behind Latavius, and I think we worked hard at that and have a couple of guys
        that can do that.\"\n\nSERIES HISTORY: The ninth regular-season meeting, Ravens
        lead series 6-2. Raiders snapped a four-game losing streak in Week 2 last
        season with a 37-33 win as quarterback Derek Carr completed 30 of 46 passes
        for 351 yards, four touchdowns and one interception. Michael Crabtree caught
        nine passes for 111 yards and a touchdown and Amari Cooper seven passes for
        109 yards, including a 68-yard scoring pass. The Raiders have never beaten
        the Ravens in Baltimore, losing their inaugural game at Memorial Stadium in
        1996 and all four games at their current home. In the lone postseason game
        between the two, the Ravens beat the Raiders 16-3 on Jan, 14, 2011, in the
        AFC championship game at the Oakland Coliseum en route to a Super Bowl championship\n\n--Some
        Raiders players were in shock with the news that fullback Marcel Reece, a
        four-time Pro Bowl selection who played with the franchise with 2008, had
        been released.\n\nReece, 31, was serving a four-game suspension for violating
        the NFL policy on performance enhancing drugs. After the appeal was denied
        (Reece said a chemical reaction to a permitted supplement was the cause) the
        Raiders fullback missed the last game of the 2015 season and the first three
        games of the 2016 season.\n\nAlthough the Raiders had a roster spot open,
        they opted to release Reece.\n\n\"I was expecting to come in today and catch
        up and get to work,\" fullback Jamize Olawale said. \"It caught me off guard.
        But I talked to him. He seems to be in a good place. It's hard, though. He
        was big on this locker room, big on this team and he and I are pretty close.\"\n\nLong-snapper
        Jon Condo, along with kicker Sebastian Janikowski and special teams ace Taiwan
        Jones, are the only Raiders who were brought in by Al Davis.\n\n\"I understand
        it's a business and everything, but it's a shock,\" Condo said. \"He meant
        so much to the organization, and he was so loyal. Mr. Davis believed in him,
        and that's not something you forget. You think of a Raider, that's Marcel.
        He was proud to wear silver \n\nand black.\"\n\n--Tackle Vadal Alexander,
        a seventh-round pick out of LSU, found himself a crucial role in the third
        week of his career.\n\nAlexander was inactive in Week 1 in his home town of
        New Orleans against the Saints, and then played a single snap in Week 2 against
        Atlanta. On that play, Alexander supplied a block as an extra tight end on
        a one-yard touchdown run by Latavius Murray.\n\n\"I'm the type of guy who
        always knew I could play and deliver,\" Alexander said. \"Coach (Mike) Tice
        and the Raiders needed me. I had no doubt I was ready to play.\"\n\nNOTES:

        Ga. -- Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan will take a hot hand into Sunday's NFC
        South showdown with the Carolina Panthers at the Georgia Dome.\n\nLast season,
        Ryan struggled in his first year in coordinator Kyle Shanahan's offense. With
        a better mastery of the attack, he has the Falcons off to a 2-1 start and
        in position to take early-season control of the division.\n\nRyan's 119 passer
        rating is tied for best in the NFL with New England's Jimmy Garoppolo. In
        the first three games of the season, Ryan has completed passes to nine, eight
        and eight different receivers as defenses have tried to take All-Pro wide
        receiver Julio Jones away from the passing game. \n\n\"He's had a real command
        at the line of scrimmage,\" Falcons coach Dan Quinn said. \"Anytime you see
        a quarterback throw to that many different people and hit to that many different
        spots. That's exactly what you're looking for.\" \n\nThe Falcons got off to
        a fast start last season, but Ryan was leaning mainly on Jones and the emergence
        of running back Devonta Freeman. This season, in addition to all of the receivers,
        running back Tevin Coleman is contributing along with Freeman.\n\nQuinn's
        confidence in the offense is growing. He kept the offense on the field in
        two fourth-down situations on the plus-side of the 50-yard line against the
        New Orleans Saints on Monday night.\n\n\"He's taking care of the ball and
        making very good decisions in that way,\" Quinn said of Ryan. \"We're improving
        down in the red zone. The guys are putting a lot of work into that area.\"\n\nAfter
        struggling in the red zone last season, the Falcons have been far more productive
        through three games. They've scored on eight of their past 10 red zone trips,
        which includes a kneel-down at the end of the Saints game.\n\nDuring one stretch
        the offense scored touchdowns on five consecutive possessions. And the Falcons
        hope to keep things moving against the Panthers.\n\nRyan has played well against
        the Panthers, recording six games with a passer rating of 100-plus against
        the Panthers. During his career, Ryan has averaged 264.1 passing yards per
        game, while completing 64.8 percent of his passes and throwing 72 touchdowns
        against the NFC South.\n\nQuinn has been quick to praise Shanahan and the
        rest of the offensive coaches.   \n\n\"I thought No. 1, they did a good job
        getting the guys prepared,\" Quinn said of the New Orleans game. \n\nThe offensive
        line has played well, too.\n\n\"I've got to give a lot of credit to the offensive
        line and to (center) Alex Mack,\" Quinn said. \"I thought they have really
        sustained on blocks that has allowed the run game to open up.\"\n\nThe Falcons
        didn't have any penalties by the offense against the Saints.\n\n\"As you know,
        penalties were a big topic of discussion for us, so offensively to have no
        penalties down and no turnovers in a loud environment, I was really pleased
        to see that,\" Quinn said. \n\nThe Falcons, who dropped their opener against
        Tampa Bay before beating Oakland and New Orleans on the road, know they are
        facing their toughest opponent of the season in the Panthers.\n\n\"They do
        a number of different things really well,\" Quinn said. \"It's really led
        off in the run game. They've got a number of different packages that they
        feature. The quarterback's a factor in the run game.\"\n\nJust four games
        into the season and the Falcons will have played all of the NFC South teams.
        \n\n\"We know this is a tough matchup for us division game, and I think we're
        pumped that the league decided to have some of these right off the bat for
        us,\" Quinn said. \"Another chance for us to do it at home with our crowd
        here after two games on the road. We couldn't be more thrilled to get going
        here with the crowd here at home.\"\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings defeated the
        Panthers 22-10 and sacked quarterback Cam Newton eight times last week, but
        the Falcons don't believe the Vikings left them a blueprint on how to stop
        Carolina.\n\n\"I certainly wish that was the case,\" Quinn said. \"We'd put
        it in verbatim. I thought they played a really good game. There's no doubt
        about that in terms of sometimes those games happen where you can kind of
        get on a roll and things happen, we've been a part of them both offensively
        and defensively through the years where one side kind of hits on some things
        and goes.\"\n\nSERIES HISTORY: 43th regular-season meeting. Falcons lead series
        25-17. The Falcons won the last meeting 20-13 on Dec. 27, 2015 at the Georgia
        Dome. The defeat was Carolina's only loss during the regular season. The Panthers
        had won five of the previous six meetings.\n\nMEDICAL WATCH: WR Julio Jones
        (calf) was injured against the Raiders in Week 2, but is expected to play
        against the Panthers. He was limited in practice on Wednesday. ... Ryan, who
        injured his left thumb against the Saints, was listed on the team's official
        injury report but fully participated in practice on Wednesday. ... WR Taylor
        Gabriel (hamstring), RB Tevin Coleman (ankle) and DE Brooks Reed (shoulder)
        were limited Wednesday. ... LB Paul Worrilow (groin surgery), LB De'Vondre
        Campbell (ankle) and WR Mohamed Sanu (shoulder) did not practice.\n\nGAME
        PLAN: Tampa Bay's Austin Seferian-Jenkins, Oakland's Clive Walford and New
        Orleans' Coby Fleener all caught touchdown passes against the Falcons. None
        have been to a Pro Bowl and Seferian-Jenkins has since been cut and signed
        to a new team. If the Falcons couldn't contain those tight ends, what are
        they going to do with Carolina's Greg Olsen? \n\nThey will use a lot of zone
        coverages and rookie safety Keanu Neal to take away Cam Newton's favorite
        receiver. Neal was drafted to add a physical presence to the defense. He also
        can help in pass coverage against running backs and tight ends. He performed
        will in coverage against the Saints. \n\n\"I don't have a number right now
        for when he was targeted or if there were catches to his side, but I know
        he had a good pass breakup on one of the zone plays where he came up,\" Quinn
        said. \"We matched him up on the tight ends and the running backs which are
        some hard matchups, but we know he's equipped to handle that, so that's why
        we tried to feature him in that way.\"\n\nAtlanta enters with the league's
        top-ranked scoring offense at 34.7 points per game and has a plethora of playmakers
        in the running and passing games. Carolina's defense should prove the stiffest
        test to date, however, and look for coordinator Kyle Shanahan to get RBs Devonte
        Freeman and Tevin Coleman involved early in an effort to help protect the
        defense. Atlanta is averaging 5.0 yards per carry, and the tandem has also
        combined for 19 receptions. QB Matt Ryan clearly feels more comfortable in
        his second year in Shanahan's system, and has already connected with 11 different
        receivers. That type of depth and ability to strike underneath and over the
        top will stress Carolina's secondary.\n\nMATCHUPS TO WATCH:\n\n--Panthers
        WR Kelvin Benjamin, who only had one target last week against the Vikings,
        vs. Falcons CB Desmond Trufant, who went to the Pro Bowl last season: Benjamin
        was taken away by the zone coverages that the Vikings ran last week. After
        missing last season, he has caught 13 passes for 199 yards and three touchdowns.
        Benjamin had nine catches for 109 yards and a touchdown on Nov. 16, 2014,
        the last meeting that he played in. Trufant is off to another strong start
        and will shadow Benjamin when the Falcons are in man-to-man.  \n\n--Panthers
        MLB Luke Kuechly vs. Falcons QB Matt Ryan: Kuechly is off to another strong
        start. The Panthers give him defensive audibles to attempt to match what Ryan
        is calling for the Falcons. It a battle of wits at the line of scrimmage by
        the two Boston College products. Since entering league in 2012, Kuechly leads
        NFL in tackles (625). He had an interception in the last meeting on Dec. 13,
        2015. \n\nRyan passed for 306 yards and a touchdown to lead the Falcons to
        the only regular-season victory over the Panthers in 2015. He's aiming for
        his fifth consecutive game against Carolina with 300-plus yards.]]>\n      </long>\n
